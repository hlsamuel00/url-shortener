## Lessons Learned:
TBD
<!-- I learned a great deal building this project:
  * Backend - I developed a better sense of how the backend is structured and how all parts of MVC communicate with each other
  * Authentication - I utilized Passport.js to take advantage of the authentication packages which made authentication for users easier
  * Architecture - This was my first introduction into MVC which helped make the structure for my application much more streamlined. 
  * Templating Language - Previously I was using EJS for my templating, but love the syntax of HandleBars a bit more. I will continue to explore different templates to find my groove and the pros and cons of each. -->
